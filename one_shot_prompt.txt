do it step by step
#answer: 1. In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends.
2. In May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April, which means she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May.
3. To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we add the number of clips she sold in each month: 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips.

So, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.
